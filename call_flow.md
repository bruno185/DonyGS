## Main flow

### Startup / Load

- 🔧 **`main()`** — Entry point
  - → 🔧 **`createModel3D()`** — allocate arrays, init metadata (auto-scale / backup pointers)
  - → 🔧 **`loadModel3D(model, filename)`** — orchestrates model loading
    - → 🔧 **`readVertices()`** — read `v x y z` into Fixed arrays
    - → 🔧 **`readFaces_model()`** — parse faces into packed index buffers

### Parameter parsing / Auto-fit

- 🔧 **`getObserverParams(&params, model)`** — interactive parameter parsing
  - reads angles H/V/W and screen rotation
  - If user presses ENTER for distance: a precomputed auto-fit suggestion may be applied if available; on-the-fly auto-fit is disabled.
  - else: set `params->distance` from user input

---

## Main render loop

- Enter main render loop (`bigloop`):
  - 🔧 **`processModelFast(model, &params, filename)`** — runs every frame; ultra-fast transformation + projection
    - precompute trig products (Fixed32)
    - For each vertex (tight Fixed32 loop): transform → compute `xo/yo/zo` → project to `x2d/y2d`
    - **Note:** runtime auto-fit is *not* applied inside `processModelFast` — any autoscale must be applied ahead of time; the auto-fit helper has been removed and archived to `chutier.txt`. `processModelFast` operates on already-scaled model vertices.
    - 🔧 **`calculateFaceDepths()`** — compute per-face `z_min/z_max/z_mean`, display flags, planar coefficients (Newell). Optionally performs observer-space back-face culling (plane D <= 0) when the `B` toggle is enabled.
    - 🔧 **`painter_newell_sancha()`** — sort faces by depth and correct ambiguous order (qsort + corrections). When back-face culling is enabled, the painter builds and sorts a list limited to faces with `display_flag == 1` (visible faces), performs order corrections only on that sub-list for efficiency and correctness, and appends culled faces afterward to preserve `sorted_face_indices` stability.
      - Collects *inconclusive pairs* (pairs of faces where order is ambiguous) into an **in-memory buffer** for later inspection; note: the buffer `inconclusive_pairs` is now a global buffer (preallocated for performance) used by diagnostic and framing helpers.

    - ⚠️ **Wireframe mode** — handled via the `framePolyOnly` flag and `drawPolygons()` (no separate `processModelWireframe()` function in the current codebase). Use `framePolyOnly=1` to render wireframe previews.

- 🔧 **`drawPolygons(model, faces, face_count, vert_count)`** — render loop
  - uses sorted faces; for each face builds QuickDraw polygon from `vtx->x2d/y2d` (these already reflect any model-space auto-scaling applied ahead of time; auto-fit is disabled — archived implementation is in `chutier.txt`). When back-face culling is active, `faces->sorted_face_indices` contains visible faces first (sorted) followed by culled faces; `drawPolygons` still checks `display_flag` and skips any face with `display_flag == 0` at draw time.
  - Fill + Frame polygon (QuickDraw)
  - There is also a helper `frameInconclusivePairs()` that can frame (in white) polygons listed in the `inconclusive_pairs` buffer for debugging/diagnostic display.

### UI / Input handling

- `startgraph()` / render / `endgraph()` / `DoText()` / optional `DoColor()`
- Keys: Space (info), N (new model), Arrows / A Z (angles/distance), `K` (edit angles/distance without reloading model), `+`/`-` (adjust autoscale), `B` (toggle back-face culling: observer-space d<=0 test)
  - **New keys (recent additions):**
    - `D` / `d`: Inspect faces placed BEFORE a selected face in the painter order and report misplaced faces (previews in orange)
    - `S` / `s`: Inspect faces placed AFTER a selected face that should be BEFORE it (previews in pink)
    - `O` / `o`: Interactive **projected polygon overlap** inspector — prompts for two face IDs, reports YES/NO if their 2D projections overlap, and optionally previews the two faces (green/orange)
    - `L` / `l`: Label mode — show the model with each face's ID drawn at its polygon center
- `K` invokes `getObserverParams(&params, model)` interactively and applies new angles/distance without requiring a reload.
- `+`/`-` behavior: if the model is not yet auto-scaled, these keys previously performed an **auto-fit** via `fitModelToView()`; auto-fit has been disabled (see `chutier.txt` for the archived implementation). They now only increase or decrease the current `params->distance` and update `model->auto_scale`. Automatic recomputation via bounding-sphere is disabled; distance adjustments are manual. The action prints a short message (e.g., "Distance increased" / "Distance decreased").

---

## Supporting / fallback functions (short purpose)


- Bounding-sphere metric removed; auto-fit uses bbox heuristic (O(n) at load remains but is simpler)

- 🔧 **Non-destructive backup support removed** — per-vertex backup API was removed to simplify flow
- 🔧 **Wireframe mode** — implemented via the `framePolyOnly` flag and `drawPolygons()` (no separate `processModelWireframe()` function)
- 🔧 **`destroyModel3D(Model3D* model)`** — frees all memory allocated by `createModel3D()`; must be called to avoid leaks
- 🔧 **`readVertices()` / `readFaces_model()`** — file parsing helpers
- 🔧 **`frameInconclusivePairs(Model3D* model)`** — utility: frames in white all polygons currently recorded in the global `inconclusive_pairs` buffer (diagnostic; no runtime side effects beyond rendering) 
- 🔧 **`projected_polygons_overlap(Model3D* model, int f1, int f2)`** — screen-space test that returns 1 if two faces' projected 2D polygons *overlap* (proper edge intersection or containment), **0 if disjoint**. Important: *touching-only* cases (shared edge or single-vertex contact) are considered **NON-overlap** and return 0. The algorithm uses integer segment intersection (proper intersection only) then ray-casting containment; points on edges are treated as outside.
- 🔧 `void inspect_faces_before(Model3D* model, ObserverParams* params, const char* filename)` — `GS3Dp.cc:2032` — interactive wrapper bound to `D`/`d`: prints a compact per-face diagnostic and offers a wireframe preview that highlights faces placed BEFORE a selected face (misplaced faces highlighted).
- 🔧 `void inspect_faces_after(Model3D* model, ObserverParams* params, const char* filename)` — `GS3Dp.cc:2219` — interactive wrapper bound to `S`/`s`: prints faces placed AFTER a selected face that should be BEFORE it and offers a wireframe preview with highlights.
- 🔧 `void inspect_polygons_overlap(Model3D* model, ObserverParams* params, const char* filename)` — `GS3Dp.cc:2371` — interactive wrapper bound to `O`/`o`: prompts for two face IDs, reports overlap status (YES/NO), and optionally previews the two faces (green/orange); default on ENTER shows the entire model in wireframe with the two faces highlighted.
- 🔧 `void display_model_face_ids(Model3D* model, ObserverParams* params, const char* filename)` — `GS3Dp.cc:2449` — label mode bound to `L`/`l`: draws the model in wireframe and overlays each face's ID centered on that face (uses `drawFace(..., show_index=1)`), useful for debugging face ordering and references.

**Notes:** Automatic distance estimation has been disabled; distance adjustments are manual.

## Notes

- This Markdown preserves the visual grouping: **function name** + **purpose/action**, and uses `→` to show call flow.
- If you want more detail (e.g., exact file:line references or prototypes), I can append them in a table or add a per-function section with signatures.

---

### Rendering / Painter (core pipeline)
- **`void processModelFast(Model3D* model, ObserverParams* params, const char* filename)`** — `DONYGS.cc:3077` 🔧
  - Purpose: per-frame transformation & projection (Fixed32 fast loop), then face depth computation and painter dispatch.

- **`void drawPolygons(Model3D* model, int* vertex_count, int face_count, int vertex_count_total)`** — `DONYGS.cc:3913` 🔧
  - Purpose: main rasterization loop: iterate `faces->sorted_face_indices` and render polygons (Fill+Frame) using a persistent `globalPolyHandle` (QuickDraw GPI operations).
  - Checks: verifies index validity and performs bounding-box culling (screen space) before drawing.

- **`void frameInconclusivePairs(Model3D* model)`** — `DONYGS.cc:4055` 🔧

### Geometry helpers & inspectors
- **`static int projected_polygons_overlap(Model3D* model, int f1, int f2)`** — `DONYGS.cc:1850` 🔧
  - Purpose: robust screen-space overlap test between two faces' projected polygons. Returns `1` for proper overlap (positive-area intersection or containment), `0` for disjoint or touching-only.
  - Algorithm: AABB quick-reject → edge-vs-edge proper intersection (`segs_intersect_int`) → containment via `point_in_poly_int`.
  - Helpers: `segs_intersect_int()` (`DONYGS.cc:1784`), `point_in_poly_int()` (`DONYGS.cc:1797`), `orient_ll()`/`on_seg_ll()`.

- **`void inspect_polygons_overlap(Model3D* model, ObserverParams* params, const char* filename)`** — `DONYGS.cc:2371` 🔧
  - Purpose: interactive inspector (key `O`) prompting two face IDs, reports YES/NO from `projected_polygons_overlap()` and optionally renders a wireframe preview with the two faces highlighted.

- **`void inspect_faces_before/after(...)`** — `DONYGS.cc:2032` / `DONYGS.cc:2219` 🔧
  - Purpose: interactive wrappers bound to `D`/`S` keys to report faces misplaced BEFORE/AFTER a selected face and optionally preview them.
  - Notes: rely on sorting helpers such as `prepare_inspector_sort()` (`DONYGS.cc:2040`).

- **`void display_model_face_ids(Model3D* model, ObserverParams* params, const char* filename)`** — `DONYGS.cc:2449` 🔧
  - Purpose: label mode (key `L`) — draw wireframe and overlay each face's ID at polygon center to aid debugging ordering.

---

### Utilities / I/O / UI
- **`void getObserverParams(ObserverParams* params, Model3D* model)`** — `DONYGS.cc:2971` 🔧
  - Purpose: interactive text input to set angles `H/V/W` and `distance` (ENTER triggers applying precomputed auto-fit suggestion if available).

- **`void dumpFaceEquationsCSV(Model3D* model, const char* csv_filename, int alt_format)`** — `DONYGS.cc:3671` 🔧
  - Purpose: export per-face plane coefficients and depth stats to CSV for offline analysis.

- **`void compute2DFromObserver(Model3D* model, int angle_w)`** — `DONYGS.cc:4155` 🔧
  - Purpose: minimal reprojection helper (applies `angle_w` rotation and `s_global_proj_scale_fixed` to produce `x2d/y2d` arrays).

- **`void DoColor()` / `void DoText()`** — `DONYGS.cc:4183, 4213` 🔧
  - Purpose: helpers to draw palette and clear screen / textual overlays.

- **Help & UI**
  - `show_help_pager()` — prints keyboard help in pages (bound to `H`).
  - Keyboard bindings: `1/2/3` painter modes, `B` back-face culling (observer-space D<=0), `P`/`p` frame-only, `+/ -` adjust projection scale (manual), `A/Z` adjust distance, `K` edit angles/distance (ENTER may apply auto-fit suggestion), `N` load new model, `E` export equations.

---

### Internal / performance & safety notes
- Fixed-point arithmetic: 16.16 Fixed32 and Fixed64 intermediates are used across transforms and plane computations (see macros: `FIXED_MUL_64`, `FIXED_DIV_64`, `FIXED_ROUND_TO_INT`).
- Trig tables: `sin_table` / `cos_table` (0..359) for extremely fast deg-based trig lookup.
- Memory re-use: global persistent `globalPolyHandle`, float painter reusable buffers (`ensure_*_capacity`) and `order_buf` to avoid per-frame allocations.
